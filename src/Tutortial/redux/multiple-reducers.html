        <p>     
            Things to remember:
            the separated reducers can not access to global variables by calling state.counter or state.result
            .It has to be passed as variable from one to another.   

        </p>

        <p>
            The core takeaway is how you can split your reducers into different slices and how you then still make
sure you get the data you need in each of these slices.
